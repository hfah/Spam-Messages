# Spam-Messages
Deep Learning -> Identification of Spam Messages ✉️🚫

GOAL
Build a deep neural network that can classify text messages as spam


Note
In order to feed text into neural networks we need to convert words into vectors.
- TFf-idf (e.g. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/
sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html)
- Word vectors (more in the "Sequence Models" class tomorrow)
- Text Classification With Python and Keras: https://www.kaggle.com/sanikamal/textclassification-with-python-and-keras
